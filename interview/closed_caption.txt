14:28:02 Bye.
14:28:03 All right, sweet. So you guys kind of know the idea behind the, or what I'm trying to find from your insights in this interview.
14:28:13 you maybe also saw some of what I wrote about the magazine itself. It's really
14:28:18 It's coming from the background of a friend of mine who is Indian, French, and she's very
14:28:23 She has a history in fashion and fashion marketing and that kind of thing. She worked for the British Fashion Council for a long time in London.
14:28:30 And so her background is very much like textiles in India and trying to bridge that east-west gap
14:28:35 but in more of a contemporary sense like trying to
14:28:38 Really?
14:28:37 you know, trying to get the many sides of the world to see each other and talk to each other.
14:28:42 Mm-hmm.
14:28:42 artistically and just kind of see what's going on in different places
14:28:45 So of course, you know, Vancouver is a place on the earth so i'm trying to
14:28:49 I'm trying to show what that's about.
14:28:51 Mm-hmm.
14:28:51 And yeah, I don't know how much time you guys got to read over the questions, et cetera.
14:28:56 Mm-hmm.
14:28:56 But it's only like eight questions or so, the long format ones. I think in general, it'd be like
14:29:02 You know, ask the question, anybody's free to jump on it we can
14:29:05 go back and forth on it for a few minutes till we run out of it.
14:29:08 And then there's the three questions that are for each of you.
14:29:11 one in each section. First, it's euro then pan then noa
14:29:16 And then there's also going to be some short form like questions that you haven't seen, just like, you know, small, cute ones like what's your favorite color? A little more interesting than that, but what's your favorite color type B?
14:29:26 And, you know, I mean, we'll just see how it goes.
14:29:30 Oh, yeah.
14:29:30 First time.
14:29:31 Thank you.
14:29:35 Yeah. So yeah, if you remember, the idea was kind of this context process expression, very nicely labeled by our friend Noah.
14:29:43 three phases of this thing, right? So we'll start with context. First question then
14:29:48 Thank you.
14:29:48 is one you haven't seen before it's
14:29:50 What is Vancouver to you and how would you describe it in three words?
14:29:55 Wow.
14:30:01 Hmm.
14:30:04 Start with what is Vancouver to you?
14:30:06 Vancouver.
14:30:08 I think it's like a…
14:30:13 It's…
14:30:14 I feel like it's a training ground
14:30:18 Woo!
14:30:18 Yeah, it's like a training ground and uh
14:30:21 It's small.
14:30:24 But it's like…
14:30:28 so much stuff comes out of here.
14:30:30 you know so much stuff comes out of here like
14:30:33 And I think people are like.
14:30:36 waiting for like me and Noah and Euro always talk about this one. It's like people are waiting for Vancouver to like
14:30:43 oh yeah, Vancouver is going to blow up next year
14:30:46 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
14:30:47 Bro, who is going to blow up like but it's like, nah, dude, like Vancouver's already been on
14:30:51 It's like been on and like the people that come out of here
14:30:56 end up doing some crazy shit on whatever scale, whether it be like
14:31:01 technology, you know, science, literature you know
14:31:05 movies and all this shit like
14:31:07 Bye.
14:31:08 And I like putting movies in air quotes but uh
14:31:13 Yeah, Vancouver's definitely
14:31:18 I like the training ground idea. I fuck with that.
14:31:19 Yeah, that's that.
14:31:22 Mm-hmm.
14:31:20 Fuck with that. You too, Noah. Euro.
14:31:23 Any words?
14:31:26 It's home.
14:31:28 Home. Fact.
14:31:31 Fresh.
14:31:30 Dumb fact.
14:31:32 Yeah, I was going to say the same. It's definitely
14:31:39 like as much as everything is happening, it's like, I feel like it's so much more
14:31:45 focused back on like
14:31:48 the individual's life and then your lifestyle
14:31:53 Mm-hmm.
14:31:52 in the city, regardless of what you do
14:31:54 just because there is so many different pockets and so many different issues
14:31:58 Yeah.
14:32:02 Mm-hmm.
14:32:00 Lovely. Real. I agree with a lot of that. Okay, first big question. How have you seen the city change physically and culturally in the last 10 years?
14:32:10 something like the size of the city, the sprawl, the demographics, economic profiles, the athleisure taking over, marijuana legalization, suburban sprawl.
14:32:21 10 years, how has it changed since we left high school just before that?
14:32:26 2014.
14:32:25 2014 to 2024, bro, is like the craziest jump from like
14:32:31 like fashion
14:32:33 like, I mean, the global influence of fashion and arts culture and music and hip hop and all this other stuff like
14:32:38 over the last 10 years and how vancouver's
14:32:43 kind of like it's it's kind of
14:32:44 I don't know, man, like…
14:32:47 a lot more people, a lot more a lot more
14:32:52 do like white people are becoming the crazy minority, bro, for real like
14:32:55 Yeah, fact.
14:32:56 It's insane. There's a lot of other people like of course you still see like Europeans and shit but like
14:33:01 There's a lot of like Asian, a lot of Africans, a lot of Indians pulling up, a lot of everybody pulling up and like.
14:33:08 just equalizing it.
14:33:10 Yeah.
14:33:12 throwing it off balance, I guess. And it's dope to see just like
14:33:17 everybody like have their own
14:33:20 like version of Vancouver. Like every single person comes here and they got their own idea of how it's supposed to be.
14:33:27 and um
14:33:28 I mean, that's the only way that it can be realistically but uh
14:33:31 marijuana legalization
14:33:33 I don't really know. I feel like it was cooler when it was illegal.
14:33:40 And yeah, I don't really spend too much time in the suburbs.
14:33:43 But I'm pretty sure the suburb has always been fresh for sure.
14:33:47 is that the city life is
14:33:49 it's is we're caught up in a lot of
14:33:53 a lot of shit. Like in the area that we live in anyways, it's like
14:33:57 Some Saturday mornings you wake up and you hear like the same person screaming for like two hours
14:34:02 And I don't know what that was like 10 years ago
14:34:06 But now that's just…
14:34:08 I'm just so curious as to what's going on there. There's so many like there's only so many one-sided stories that like
14:34:14 we witness on the day to day.
14:34:17 Yep, fuck.
14:34:18 About 10 years has been insane. And now we've got like ai and
14:34:21 Motherfuckers think they're actually smart and shit because they're putting all their shit through AI and then parroting everything that they're saying opposed to like 10 years ago, like you had to actually understand
14:34:32 like you have to understand like the way that you have to understand like uh
14:34:38 the way a person had to put themselves and build themselves up opposed to like now it's like it's such
14:34:45 It's such quick access to the knowledge.
14:34:47 that we could like, oh yeah, bro, I've been doing this forever, bro. But it's like, nah, dude, you just fucking chat GPT.
14:34:53 He's looked it up, man, yeah.
14:34:55 all the answers and you got them you know so
14:34:57 What about you to Vancouver change 10 years.
14:35:02 Definitely.
14:35:05 Demographic-wise…
14:35:07 Yeah.
14:35:07 A lot of like…
14:35:09 More Jamaicans now, I'd say in surrey.
14:35:12 More people.
14:35:12 Whoa.
14:35:15 It's definitely like, I see a lot of japanese people
14:35:19 Definitely more artists
14:35:22 than ever at least like in the studio and like
14:35:27 Mainly music. At least, I mean, I'm in the music scene, so it makes sense that I would mainly see that.
14:35:34 But it's definitely the homeless situation is pretty much the same, I'd say.
14:35:39 Yep.
14:35:39 That's not changed.
14:35:41 Okay.
14:35:40 I don't know if it's worse or better, but
14:35:44 It seems like it's exactly the same.
14:35:48 No?
14:35:48 Yeah, I think after COVID, like, or like even during like a lot of
14:35:54 like maybe like the racial populations like
14:35:58 the minorities increase but like part of the socioeconomic aspect of it like definitely
14:36:05 more rent has gone up.
14:36:07 more wealthy people have moved into the city and then a lot of
14:36:10 people, I think.
14:36:12 Okay.
14:36:14 Yeah.
14:36:12 either not been able to pay their bills or ended up on the sheets?
14:36:19 Um.
14:36:20 Culturally, though, like Naman was saying, I think they're like, I don't know if there's like a global TikTok effect or more just like the timing of our city and like
14:36:29 the amount of creatives, I'd say across every industry like
14:36:35 Yeah. Like I'm more led to believe it's like a globalization thing and just like
14:36:41 Thank you.
14:36:41 people figuring out the power of unique storytelling or individual storytelling
14:36:50 But the city has been, I think it's like, there's a lot, it has a lot more to offer now for
14:36:55 people trying to get into
14:36:57 whatever it is that they are into.
14:37:00 Mm-hmm.
14:37:00 uh be like outdoor activities or creative activities like
14:37:04 I'd say the communities are growing and the need for them is becoming
14:37:10 a lot more
14:37:13 known and felt like
14:37:17 Yeah, like Rami has like come spin, which I feel like changed the entire DJ scene in the city.
14:37:23 Mm-hmm.
14:37:24 like teaching people and like i'll tell you there's a lot more like community engagement things like even with like
14:37:30 you know sports like climbing and
14:37:33 Mm-hmm.
14:37:32 Yeah, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff happening.
14:37:35 a lot of activities
14:37:38 Yeah.
14:37:39 Noah, you touched a little bit on the rent and the increasing cost of living here. Next question is Vancouver has a lot of
14:37:45 challenges for the artistic scene and the creative industries in general, among them high living costs.
14:37:50 real estate development that's renovating, pushing people away, strict liquor and closing rules for clubs and things and zoning.
14:37:57 And also the geographical isolation from other centers like Toronto, Montreal, New York, even LA,
14:38:01 What do you think is the biggest challenge or what are the biggest challenges for Vancouver creatives and
14:38:06 Importantly, are they unique to Vancouver?
14:38:12 Noah, start us off.
14:38:13 I would say like.
14:38:16 create like the creative
14:38:18 arc in general. I think it's a like very personal there's a very personal aspect to it in terms of
14:38:26 the challenges and like the belief sets that one has when they're making that
14:38:31 maybe are more challenging than the external uh
14:38:36 challenges presented by
14:38:38 someone's efforts like
14:38:41 Vancouver definitely
14:38:43 I wouldn't say that the money is necessarily in it like we're definitely in that like fourth
14:38:50 stage like gentrification where there's like a lot of people with money, but that are like very
14:38:56 far away from the people that are doing the things.
14:39:00 And…
14:39:00 Mm-hmm.
14:39:01 It's like an interesting, like, I don't know what's it compared to like
14:39:06 It's almost like, I don't know, like…
14:39:08 in US cities having like rich neighborhoods right beside poor neighborhoods it's like there is that effect
14:39:14 Where…
14:39:15 the money blinds the pockets of like culture or like the people that are actually
14:39:21 having the experience that's not so
14:39:24 cookie cutter like uh
14:39:28 And I would say like that's the heart of the culture is with the people that do have
14:39:35 less like that's like, you know, so much of creativity comes from necessity and
14:39:41 Bye.
14:39:41 I think…
14:39:47 that that gap
14:39:49 that economic gap is like
14:39:53 super felt in like
14:39:55 in the opportunities, you know, like, I don't know. I want to compare it to like LA or New York where there's there's more people that are in between that that help bridge that gap.
14:40:02 Yeah, good points.
14:40:04 Yeah, that almost create that ladder like
14:40:06 to allow people that are really just can only focus on the ideas to meet people with money
14:40:12 But here I would say
14:40:13 To me, there isn't really the opportunity for going from being just an artist to making it as an artist. There isn't that ladder, you're saying?
14:40:19 Yeah, like, yeah, even that, yeah, not in a direct sense, but like in the sense that
14:40:25 there's a lot of like there's not a lot of working creatives that are like doing really interesting, cool shit. It's very either corporatized or
14:40:34 very DIY. And like, yeah, there's
14:40:36 Yeah.
14:40:37 I feel like in a lot of other larger cities, they're
14:40:40 Either because industries are based out of those cities or
14:40:44 that just has that history like that
14:40:46 there is more of a ladder in terms of, okay.
14:40:50 I started my ideas and I want to get somewhere with it
14:40:53 there might be more of a natural process. But I still think like as a creative, the struggle is definitely way more
14:41:01 one of yourself and like yeah
14:41:04 Yeah.
14:41:04 Yeah.
14:41:05 Naming any thoughts?
14:41:08 Are the challenges for Vancouver unique to Vancouver?
14:41:17 I feel like…
14:41:20 Yes. Just because the environment is so
14:41:26 particular and like
14:41:29 It definitely affects the way people move.
14:41:32 And like just the way the city was built
14:41:35 you know just like what it was built off of and like
14:41:39 What is that?
14:41:40 Just like…
14:41:42 I feel like the infrastructure is very like it's like a port city so like
14:41:48 Yep.
14:41:47 It's not really…
14:41:50 made to be an artist, which kind of works in its favor in some ways, you know, where like you can really focus on your own thing
14:41:58 And…
14:41:57 I'm curious. I want to explore that. How do you think a port city
14:42:01 is not for the artist.
14:42:02 Well, I just feel like the mentality of the city is like very like work, like work. I mean, a lot of cities are like that, you know, but
14:42:07 Right. Yep.
14:42:09 Vancouver's like, I mean…
14:42:12 Going back to like New York and LA, like they have that too, but they have more
14:42:18 activities laid out for artists, you know, where it's like you can
14:42:28 Bye.
14:42:22 have that mentality of working hard, but there's also like all this shit happening at night. There's all these events going on. And now we're seeing more of it.
14:42:31 but like
14:42:32 So maybe a big piece of it is if Vancouver was 10 times larger.
14:42:35 Yes. Yeah. We're still like building. I feel like the whole reason we have all this construction going on is we're trying to catch up.
14:42:42 to like tokyo and New York and L.A.
14:42:44 To Tokyo.
14:42:48 Cheeky 30 times expansion
14:42:51 Mm-hmm.
14:42:51 We just got to reset, bro.
14:42:54 Bye.
14:42:54 Get rid of everything.
14:42:57 Thank you.
14:42:56 Pam, any specific challenges you see in Vancouver?
14:42:59 Really creative.
14:43:00 um
14:43:02 Aside from…
14:43:05 what was just mentioned.
14:43:08 I think it's still very…
14:43:11 very…
14:43:12 Like Noah said, it's nuanced.
14:43:15 Yeah.
14:43:14 to anybody that's approaching
14:43:16 whatever industry and whatever they're trying to get out of it mainly.
14:43:21 And definitely…
14:43:24 doing the DIY type shit where it's like you're
14:43:29 going off of the pieces that
14:43:32 So you're creating a world off of the pieces that you found
14:43:35 useful to yourself.
14:43:38 And that's like validation free. Like you don't need
14:43:42 all these people from the industries
14:43:44 telling you that your pants are fire or that your music's good or that
14:43:48 your videos are awesome or whatever, because they're going to try to do that thing that Noah was talking about where it's like, yeah, you're just going to become like a
14:43:56 corporate asset
14:43:58 And you're going to help
14:44:00 like shape like
14:44:03 the vision of what this company or what this
14:44:07 this organization couldn't have done without a person who's actually in the streets
14:44:12 Like seeing the shit on the day to day and applying that
14:44:17 applying the lessons that are learned
14:44:19 out on the concrete.
14:44:21 to like this comfortable, luxurious life that we all have because like regardless of
14:44:27 the grant being expensive as fuck and like
14:44:31 It's harder to get jobs now, I guess, unless you know somebody who knows somebody. I mean, it's always been like that, but
14:44:37 Yeah.
14:44:37 Now it's in 2024, it's become more of like a prevalent theme
14:44:41 And how one finds or navigates success.
14:44:45 And like all the other shit, like.
14:44:48 like the liquor closing, but people are still getting faded all day. It doesn't even matter like
14:44:52 buying alcohol and they're storing the alcohol
14:44:59 Literally.
14:44:55 Like just so they can have a good time. So that's just like, I feel like people do whatever the fuck they want. Like you can speed out here in front of the police and
14:45:02 people that are drinking beers on the bus and on the train and like
14:45:05 Hell yeah. Prohibition, baby.
14:45:05 I don't know like yeah dude like i think the whole, uh.
14:45:12 I've dealt with some like racial profiling for sure
14:45:15 Just off of that, like.
14:45:17 being black and like
14:45:20 like having to like just like not get away with certain things that other people can't get away with and that's like
14:45:25 No.
14:45:26 That doesn't happen that often, but like it's in the back of my mind when I'm moving to the streets like
14:45:33 I'm still a visible minority
14:45:35 And however that affects a person's like
14:45:38 subconscious mind, whether it comes to any opportunity, like whether it be some hearsay
14:45:43 It's not going to be…
14:45:48 as a…
14:45:48 Just because of all the history behind like systemic
14:45:53 issues, all that stuff is going into the decision of whatever happens to me at the end of the day, you know, and that's just
14:45:59 high visible minority life. So all this other shit is kind of like
14:46:02 like yeah like we're like America for sure like we're definitely like la we have like some pockets of New York. We're super
14:46:09 So it's a small city
14:46:11 It's a small city, but some things are spread apart. Like if you're not in downtown vancouver
14:46:15 No.
14:46:16 like you have to like drive to like go to Richmond or like drive to like
14:46:20 Yeah, it's definitely North American infrastructurally city. You got to drive everywhere, yeah.
14:46:23 Yeah, so it's still like super, super…
14:46:24 No carnal money.
14:46:26 Yes, super spread apart, but…
14:46:28 No.
14:46:28 I think the largest issue would definitely just be the whole
14:46:37 We're trying to
14:46:38 do something that's already been done.
14:46:41 You know, and the people that did it
14:46:44 or letting us attempt
14:46:47 or letting us attempt
14:46:48 to try and do that when like they know that, oh yeah, you can't do this unless you've been in this shit for like X amount of time or you know this many people but like the way that it's set up
14:46:57 Yep.
14:46:57 It's like, I think it's based, it's fully set up for like
14:47:01 nepotism type shit, bro. Like you have to know something like you have to know somebody like family has to know somebody like
14:47:06 you have to just be very well connected in order to get to a position of quote unquote like
14:47:14 Yeah.
14:47:12 power, you know, and it's about like power at the end of the day. Like people are like talking about influence and like
14:47:19 all this like community, there is community stuff but then it's like
14:47:22 superficial almost
14:47:24 Yeah, so maybe I'll interrupt you on that point. I want to ask euro
14:47:27 Because you're probably somebody who frequently collaborates the most with other artists in the city.
14:47:31 Just by virtue of being in the music scene as much as you are.
14:47:35 And being an instrumentalist, what do you think it means to be an artist in the city? Does the community move more as a whole or is it compartmentalized, as some of these guys were saying?
14:47:44 Do you think the artist here is different from what the artist is in other cities?
14:47:50 Yeah, just because the state of the city and the scene is still…
14:47:54 I mean, obviously, yeah, it has
14:47:57 like a foundation, but I feel like everyone's realizing now more than ever
14:48:03 we should be there with each other.
14:48:05 And like, so…
14:48:08 that's it's a little newer.
14:48:11 Then…
14:48:13 than that in other cities like
14:48:15 You know, people have to
14:48:17 We're trying to build something. So there's a lot more collaboration
14:48:22 Mm-hmm.
14:48:23 just like with random artists you know like
14:48:25 You can end up in the studio with anyone because everyone wants to work with anyone and they don't really care that much who you are before.
14:48:32 Bye.
14:48:33 They're just going to be in the room with you. So that gives room. I think it's a good thing.
14:48:37 You know, even if it gets fucked up and weird sometimes it's like it's better to find out
14:48:41 Hmm.
14:48:44 Yeah, for sure.
14:48:46 Okay.
14:48:46 Okay, quick question as well. If Vancouver is supposedly or it has been always called the no fun city
14:48:52 What turns it into a fun city
14:48:55 And I want to remind you guys of the 2011 Stanley Cup riots and ask you whether you think we still have that dog in us.
14:49:02 Yes.
14:49:02 Yeah. Yes.
14:49:03 Yes, yes.
14:49:05 Technology.
14:49:05 Resounding yes.
14:49:06 That dog is literally the dog that walks through the city every single day. Like that's the same dog.
14:49:09 that Doug's been working out.
14:49:11 Yeah, he's just not mad. He doesn't have enough reason to attack. It's crazy. You see it everywhere you go.
14:49:20 Yeah.
14:49:21 And I think it's good to have that type of energy for sure but like
14:49:25 it's just the application of it, you know, like you should be
14:49:29 you should be down for your city
14:49:32 In terms of like, oh yeah, this is what we're trying to do or like this is this is our team like this is our, but like it shouldn't.
14:49:37 get to a point where we're like fucking
14:49:40 Doing all that shit that happened back then and justifying
14:49:43 Our city.
14:49:45 Good.
14:49:44 Yeah, it's crazy.
14:49:49 But I think it's a pretty fun city honestly like
14:49:53 like the fine is wherever you are type city
14:49:56 Oh, fuck.
14:49:57 And if you are…
14:50:01 like…
14:50:03 like, I wouldn't say focused
14:50:05 But if you're just doing what you're doing.
14:50:07 And you've got good people with you.
14:50:09 then that's all you really need. Just like anywhere else. That's where I felt like
14:50:16 Yeah, for real.
14:50:13 Vancouver's just like any other place, just like any other place. And you just have to like
14:50:19 really be having a good time for yourself
14:50:23 before anything else because like some people like that's where the validation comes from. It's like I don't want to like.
14:50:27 go to a party because all these people are all these
14:50:30 fake cool guys you're like yo
14:50:32 Dude, there's this fucking party, bro. Like, there's going to be this and this and this. I don't want to just show face
14:50:38 You know, I hate just showing face. I want to show up
14:50:41 to like experience something and like
14:50:45 like not be like tiptoeing
14:50:47 When I'm there, you know?
14:50:48 No, I agree.
14:50:49 So that's where it's kind of like weird
14:50:51 It's kind of weird, but that's not everywhere
14:50:54 that's not everywhere. That's just like if you're really trying to be in the scene, quote unquote, like I don't really care about the scene.
14:51:00 I like the…
14:51:05 Okay.
14:51:03 I just like the world, bro. Like the world, how it manifests itself
14:51:08 In different scenarios, you know, we get to see someone's expression
14:51:12 Yeah.
14:51:12 expression comes from, well, I say they're from japan
14:51:14 or say they're from like India or say they're from like Africa or whatever.
14:51:18 You're going to see their expression
14:51:21 of their their motherland.
14:51:24 and the cultural assimilation of coming over here and after having to figure out a way to like communicate
14:51:29 You know, and you
14:51:31 Yeah, bro, it's really beautiful to see
14:51:34 that type of stuff unfold.
14:51:36 When it's especially when it's like you don't need
14:51:39 like 100 people there to tell you that it's cool
14:51:43 No, fuck.
14:51:43 You know, if it's like 10 people
14:51:47 And it's dope. It's going to be like 10 times crazier because it's so intimate and so such a small select few people.
14:51:55 show up for it and they
14:51:56 are able to see it for what it is.
14:51:58 You know, that's like, yeah, that's anti
14:52:01 So maybe that ties into the reason for doing things. So let's move into the process section.
14:52:07 Mm-hmm.
14:52:07 Start with Noah, maybe why do you create
14:52:10 What is the philosophy behind choosing this path in life every day?
14:52:17 Can I ask that one more time.
14:52:22 Okay.
14:52:20 Why do you create and what is the philosophy behind choosing this path in life every day?
14:52:27 I create because I feel like
14:52:31 Most of the time words don't do
14:52:34 the experience enough
14:52:38 justice or just
14:52:41 Yeah, it doesn't feel like a
14:52:43 to your way of expressing
14:52:46 uh…
14:52:48 what my experience is on the day to day
14:52:52 What was the second part of the question? Sorry.
14:52:54 Yeah, no, you answered it well. What's the philosophy behind choosing to do this?
14:52:59 Yeah, healing. Every day just like accumulating
14:53:06 you know experiences and like moments and
14:53:11 Yeah, like through like, you know, physical activity, like any of these expressions can help but uh
14:53:17 I feel like creating something
14:53:20 To share, definitely.
14:53:24 helps me see what's next.
14:53:27 No.
14:53:28 Fire.
14:53:28 Yeah.
14:53:31 Yeah. Yeah.
14:53:31 Bye.
14:53:31 Anything to add, guys?
14:53:36 I think…
14:53:37 I want to focus on that piece of like choosing this path every day
14:53:42 Yeah, dude, it's the only thing that you can do.
14:53:45 like it's it's like
14:53:46 Perfect. Beautiful.
14:53:48 like even if you weren't trying to
14:53:51 you'd still be doing it.
14:53:53 You know, it's just it's just having the courage
14:53:55 the courage to recognize the act that is uh
14:53:59 that is shapeless, that is formless you know
14:54:02 That's the thing that we're that we're
14:54:05 all inevitably going to be left with.
14:54:08 You know, it's the formless and the shapeless
14:54:12 No.
14:54:11 So accepting that
14:54:14 like embracing it and seeing how beautiful it is right now
14:54:18 Like Noah said, it's like you'll see it
14:54:20 you'll see it again, you know, or you see more of it.
14:54:25 You know, but it's the only thing you can do
14:54:28 And every day is all you have.
14:54:31 So that's…
14:54:32 Naaman, anything to add?
14:54:33 Just keeps on going.
14:54:36 Yeah.
14:54:38 I feel like, I don't know exactly why.
14:54:42 It's kind of like a feeling, I guess.
14:54:45 Like you should do this.
14:54:48 And you know when you should and when you shouldn't.
14:54:52 It's just like, how good of a listener are you?
14:54:55 Mm-hmm.
14:54:57 For real.
14:54:57 Damn. Damn.
14:55:00 Pan, one for you. How do you reconcile a world that's obsessed with productivity and production?
14:55:05 with inspiration and a genuine creative process, can they coexist? So the world that needs productivity and production and a real creative process, can they coexist? And how does work ethic play with this?
14:55:17 I think they can coexist.
14:55:20 Just because…
14:55:22 Like that's the state that things have been in right now, but it's actually kind of like oversaturated for sure.
14:55:28 maybe it can't, hmm.
14:55:29 I think it has to be more of the creation
14:55:32 So is it like you have to abstract yourself from the world in order to be able to have your own creative process?
14:55:37 Is there like a bridge in between them?
14:55:40 Yeah, because then it's like.
14:55:40 that work ethic? What is the bridge?
14:55:42 I think you don't want to replicate, like I said earlier, you don't want to replicate like the same shit like that cookie cutter shit that no one was talking about. You don't want to do
14:55:51 what's already been done. You don't want to do that after presenting it like it's a new idea, you know?
14:55:54 But what about the idea that everything is just a remade version of everything else? Your inspirations dictate what you create.
14:56:01 I think so. I think that's true, but I also feel like inspiration is kind of like an excuse
14:56:07 See?
14:56:06 Like, I don't really like the idea of motivation and inspiration and all these other things anymore. Like I used to love it just because
14:56:14 It was such a fantasy, like a playful
14:56:18 idea that got me to stand at the cliff, you know, stand at the edge and be like, damn, like.
14:56:23 But like…
14:56:24 I wasn't jumping. I feel like inspiration is standing at the cliff
14:56:29 knowing that you could fly, but that you're not jumping or like doing anything. You're just like thinking about, oh, yo, man, like, man, I'm here. I made it to the thing and
14:56:37 this is this and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But you're not like doing the thing that you're supposed to do.
14:56:41 You know, inspiration is kind of like a buffer for me so
14:56:44 I think that the creative process is the one that
14:56:49 like you wake up and you decide what you're going to wear
14:56:51 And then after you like fucking
14:56:53 You even make breakfast or you don't.
14:56:55 And then at the start doing
14:56:56 Damn, so it's every decision throughout the day. You can't just abstract it to the one
14:56:59 moment when you're making music.
14:57:01 Yeah, it's like, dude, the music and the art is such a small part of it, but like the art is
14:57:06 how you feel when you wake up
14:57:08 That's the art, you know, and after it's like applying
14:57:13 your feelings to the world
14:57:16 You know, it's like you're pouring out a bit of yourself onto this
14:57:19 Beautiful.
14:57:19 onto this canvas and then you're able to like
14:57:24 just like it's not based off of anything
14:57:27 But right now, you know, and like we're talking about like we're talking earlier, you said some shit and it's like
14:57:34 This is the stuff that's always happening.
14:57:35 Like regardless of if you are focused on it or if you're not, it's always happening. It's like.
14:57:40 It's bigger than everybody. It's just up to the person who can acknowledge that it's always happening.
14:57:46 And who could see the beauty in that, that can share it, that changes the entire position of it. So like the work ethic
14:57:52 Yep.
14:57:52 is in like it's in the everyday. It's like you wake up
14:57:55 what do you do next? It's like, or you're already doing it. You don't even think about it. You're just doing it. It's just so deeply ingrained in
14:58:04 Correct.
14:58:03 your life you know so like that, that thing that t-shirt that I did that your job is your life, your dream is your
14:58:07 Whatever, you know, that shit.
14:58:11 it's it's all like
14:58:12 Okay.
14:58:13 just so it's flow state.
14:58:13 Yeah, it's a continuation of each other. It's a fact, a fact.
14:58:15 Yeah. But I think it can coexist
14:58:21 Because it already is, but it just depends on the context in which you want to see these things like
14:58:26 like how far you're watching them or how far you're paying attention to their growth, you know, or how deep you planted the seed
14:58:30 No.
14:58:32 And then like, oh yeah, dude, like it takes two weeks for these things to start biting. Or if you just give it enough attention and
14:58:37 It starts budding like almost instantly. You know, it's magic when it comes to
14:58:43 like.
14:58:45 the fast production of things like people do like me and Noah took like
14:58:50 months to figure out this jersey that we're working on.
14:58:53 And then like everyone's like going to China and like
14:58:56 fucking figuring out like similar patterns and getting all this stuff done. And it's like they got their jerseys done.
14:59:02 They got their jerseys done. They did the whole thing. They did a bunch of jerseys. Me and Noah only got one jersey.
14:59:07 But it's better than all those jerseys that just came out.
14:59:11 You know, so I think it's like
14:59:14 it's really it really has to be
14:59:16 attached to your life because if you're separating it
14:59:19 then you're separating it's like
14:59:22 the more separation that you have is not good. If you're able to like
14:59:26 Yeah.
14:59:28 have it all in one place.
14:59:30 You know, if you have it all in one place, then it's going to be way easier to navigate
14:59:34 like what you could do with this idea you know
14:59:37 Yeah. Okay, let me hit you guys with some quick questions. Noah, I want to start with you.
14:59:42 what or who inspires you?
14:59:48 You're amazing.
14:59:48 You guys putting up a shelf.
14:59:48 So one more time, what inspires
14:59:51 what or who inspires you?
14:59:54 Definitely the people around me and then
14:59:59 the experiences that I accumulate and
15:00:05 Yeah, with and around everyone that is around me uh
15:00:09 I would say i keep my
15:00:11 my circle pretty small, but the world is big and big
15:00:15 Hmm.
15:00:16 in between moving between my circles like i encounter a lot of different
15:00:21 people and things that
15:00:24 are highly influential to my process.
15:00:28 Hmm.
15:00:27 Perfect.
15:00:30 Pam, what's one quote or mantra you live by?
15:00:34 Oh, dude. Um…
15:00:37 I like that serenity prayer that they do in prison
15:00:40 It's like, Lord, grant me the strength to accept the things that I cannot change, the courage to…
15:00:46 the courage to change the things that I can and the ability to know the difference.
15:00:49 Yeah, the wisdom to know the difference. Fire.
15:00:52 Fire. Cook.
15:00:50 Yeah, that one's like the day the day to day.
15:00:55 Yeah, Naaman, can you separate the art from the artist
15:00:58 Yes or no?
15:01:00 Yeah.
15:01:04 Beautiful.
15:01:06 Yeah.
15:01:07 You want to add anything or leave it at yeah
15:01:08 Yeah.
15:01:09 Cool if you do.
15:01:11 Um.
15:01:13 I feel like you can, but you could also not if you choose to you know
15:01:19 Amazing.
15:01:23 Good.
15:01:22 Amazing. Okay, let's move to the expression part noah
15:01:27 Longer question for you.
15:01:30 How does an idea and the meaning behind it change once you bring it to life?
15:01:34 And even more when you make it public. So is it still the same thing? How do you understand the relationship between your own mind
15:01:39 And the ability to make something real
15:01:41 And then the world that it'll exist in. Is the idea still the same?
15:01:46 Absolutely not. I think…
15:01:49 Me and Damon are actually having this conversation last night. I think when you're making something like the idea of it even being finished is like
15:01:56 kind of like a fallacy you create to like
15:01:59 push yourself to put it, to share it
15:02:01 but like if nothing's really ever finished, it's kind of just like
15:02:06 all these moments of time that uh
15:02:10 you've put into whatever it is you're working on?
15:02:12 So how does that change when you're thinking about wanting to do something? How does that change the way that you think about it?
15:02:17 I think you just take it, let you…
15:02:20 let go of the perfectionism so you can actually do it
15:02:24 And then as soon as you choose to share it, it's definitely not yours anymore. It never really was, but…
15:02:32 The moment of control are over so
15:02:35 Mm-hmm.
15:02:35 Yeah, it's definitely fully
15:02:35 Okay, quick continuation on that.
15:02:38 Yeah.
15:02:38 what makes what makes boring
15:02:40 And this period of your creative lives different from other moments of your past
15:02:43 Do you see your creative history as a continuum or a distinct period? If you're saying that these ideas don't even really belong to you.
15:02:49 Is it a continuum or is it different historic periods?
15:02:52 It's definitely a continuum and then like
15:02:54 I feel like you can see the patterns that emerge like through, especially like for me that like, I don't have like a very set medium
15:03:02 I'm kind of looking for these large patterns that come out of
15:03:07 AliExpress and like
15:03:10 I can only see like way in hindsight, like, you know, maybe three ideas after the one that was out
15:03:17 type of stuff.
15:03:17 Man, you're banging on the correct questions. I want to ask you, how do you see the increasing cross-median role of the artists
15:03:23 Just like Bourne, right? Not a music label, not a fashion service, not a videography service. How does this ethos change in the 21st century?
15:03:29 You're not just one medium artist.
15:03:32 I think it's essential because I think like so much of what we were
15:03:37 taught was based in industry and based in
15:03:41 capital. And I think that's like a large need for the distinction, the box is to like
15:03:47 push things into a certain
15:03:49 Yeah, push them into a box so that it can be communicated but i think uh
15:03:55 In a world where everyone is unique like uh
15:03:59 the way we express like the way like pan has been saying like the way we live is the expression and uh
15:04:06 that's going to be highlighted more and more, especially with like AI and everything. I think these like very flawed human
15:04:14 things that make us human like are going to become really important and
15:04:21 only through each individual's life expression that you'll be able to identify that
15:04:28 Yeah, bye.
15:04:27 Yes. Yes.
15:04:29 Yeah.
15:04:29 For real. She's fine.
15:04:31 For real.
15:04:33 Like, as you're speaking or that question that you asked him about um
15:04:37 like the ethos of all this stuff
15:04:40 And now that it's all kind of like mixed or
15:04:45 I think it's giving a person
15:04:47 more of an opportunity to be all they can be.
15:04:51 But no.
15:04:50 You know, that's the one where it's like, it's a lot of power and it's like a lot of
15:04:55 Sorry, there's not a lot of power. It's very overwhelming and the feeling can
15:05:00 Driver person mad and
15:05:02 have them be fixated on
15:05:04 how something is going to come out or how it's going to look or whatever.
15:05:07 But I think every single person, every single person is
15:05:13 in this is the creative director of their lives.
15:05:16 You know, and then it's like whenever you're working on a project or whenever you're working on yourself or whenever you're working, it's how you get it done.
15:05:22 is the most important thing. It's not about getting it done.
15:05:23 That's a good point.
15:05:25 you know if you try to get it done, then you're rushing and you're not healed yet. And then it's like, oh, back to fucking therapy. I got to start all over again and try to like justify
15:05:37 myself to myself
15:05:39 You know, when it's like, if you do that, then you're limiting all that you can be
15:05:44 And it's just so big. It's just so big and it's
15:05:48 Yeah.
15:05:48 you can't try to tie it down
15:05:50 So I think right now is a state that it should, it was going to get here. Like we're in a renaissance period right now, especially with all this AI shit like no one's talking and like you're talking like this ai
15:06:00 And the person that has the right questions
15:06:04 You know, we now have the technology
15:06:06 to get you the answer that you need
15:06:09 you know but then it's like that answer is an even bigger question because if you're really about the research
15:06:15 And it never ends. It never ends like
15:06:18 all these like uh like uh
15:06:21 dudes that study fossils and shit.
15:06:23 like they their job's not done, bro. I don't know how many bones that they found, but they did not find all those bones.
15:06:29 you know there was still a bunch of dinosaurs
15:06:31 Just a bunch of dinosaurs. So you can't
15:06:33 You said a thing at one point you're talking about like it's overwhelming all the things that you can do, all the possibility. You know that quote by Kierkegaard the
15:06:41 Anxiety is the dizziness of possibility.
15:06:43 Crazy. That's
15:06:46 German 1700 guy go hard as fuck.
15:06:49 For real. He's like.
15:06:53 Yeah, Naaman, I want to ask you
15:06:55 The…
15:06:56 So you guys did the one thing that was pretty noteworthy was the fashion week that you guys participated in. You were doing the music for that.
15:07:02 I want to ask you how you approach
15:07:04 this more institutional side of the creative world because you also work a lot in the institutional side of it
15:07:08 like Penn being front row at the fashion week, but you doing the music how does
15:07:13 Art with a small A and art with a big a
15:07:16 Interact.
15:07:18 I guess I haven't been given any like parameters where I feel like I've
15:07:23 been limited. So it's been it's the process has been the same
15:07:27 You know, like I've been able to
15:07:28 Okay.
15:07:29 freely express
15:07:31 And that's definitely, I like that a lot it's uh
15:07:35 I guess I treated it the same as anything.
15:07:40 So it wasn't…
15:07:40 Is that specific to you or do you think that the world allows for it?
15:07:44 I think the world allows for it. You just have to like
15:07:49 Set yourself up for it to allow you to do that.
15:07:55 For real.
15:07:55 If that makes sense.
15:07:56 Noah, any words?
15:08:02 I agree. It kind of like what I was saying about like the real struggle for every creative is internally and like uh
15:08:09 like being in school right now, I feel like that's the big A and everything's about, you know, this is how this world works and
15:08:17 Wow.
15:08:18 We can acknowledge it, but not put it in a box kind of like
15:08:21 I don't know, Virgil always talked about this. It's like, as soon as we hear the box like
15:08:26 we should be turned off by it like you know like
15:08:30 Okay.
15:08:29 just for ourselves like obviously there's important
15:08:33 reasons that those boxes exist and they help us communicate and recognize
15:08:38 certain moments in time but
15:08:40 we should definitely be critical thinkers and like
15:08:43 When we see the big a can we
15:08:44 flip it to a little a kind of flip it to a bubble letter A. Like, yeah, like whatever makes sense for you
15:08:53 Mm-hmm.
15:08:53 Damn. Okay, I'll ask you a short one, Noah. What born project are you most proud of and why?
15:09:03 You hear that question?
15:09:05 No, so I cut over it.
15:09:06 Yeah, no worries. I said, what born project are you most proud of and why?
15:09:14 That's for the three of you.
15:09:16 The next one.
15:09:18 The next one.
15:09:19 Yeah, real.
15:09:22 That's just fire. I…
15:09:24 Beautiful.
15:09:24 I'm with him on that, but I like…
15:09:28 Something that I think is very significant
15:09:32 is just Stone Cold Fingers end all be all project and
15:09:36 all the things that we did in order to get that shit.
15:09:39 released on our own and the show
15:09:42 And like…
15:09:44 that was like the beginning of the beginning
15:09:47 The end for sure.
15:09:49 The prospect point, sure, which one?
15:09:51 the prospect coin show and then just like
15:09:53 the Stone Cold Finger Legacy.
15:09:57 Like everything, it was like we had to
15:10:01 Where I had to like figure out a way to like
15:10:07 like…
15:10:10 Understand.
15:10:11 You know, because it was like, it felt like Stone Cold Finger was like a lesson
15:10:15 felt like it was a lesson. And then like how born
15:10:19 like pushed out
15:10:21 like we got the little B feature, like we fucking
15:10:23 Crazy.
15:10:25 like that was like the craziest
15:10:27 It's just crazy shit, yeah.
15:10:28 like full circle type moment
15:10:31 Wait, you said legacy of Stone Cold Finger. Mike Tyson says there is no legacy, everything is dust.
15:10:38 What do you think?
15:10:37 Exactly. He's right.
15:10:40 He's right. Like to me, that's why it's like, I'm still here
15:10:44 Right? Like I'm still here. Like Stone Cold Finger is just like, there we go.
15:10:48 Ooh.
15:10:49 This is the little a big a right now in real time type shit. You know, it's like
15:10:54 Stone Cold Finger, I thought that it was something that
15:10:58 would…
15:11:00 Like, last.
15:11:03 You know, I thought they would permeate through time.
15:11:05 And like, I guess you can add like if you're looking at
15:11:10 just the three letters, you know?
15:11:12 It doesn't have to be ART, just any three letters to me. I'm thinking God
15:11:18 Okay.
15:11:18 energy comes to these three letters it's like it's everything like it's everything. So you
15:11:23 It falls back on the same thing. Like I couldn't even see the big A. I couldn't see the little A. It's all just like God. It's all just like energy. It's all just like right now.
15:11:32 And with that stone cold finger.
15:11:34 the end all be all project it's like
15:11:37 I didn't.
15:11:39 i dude like none of that shit could have happened like no no managed island
15:11:46 Right.
15:11:45 No man can do any of that shit by themselves and
15:11:48 Your favorite project?
15:11:50 Wow.
15:11:51 Favorite project. I'm definitely with noah like yeah the next one is going to be crazy
15:11:56 But if there's, I guess…
15:12:00 The home we all stayed in together
15:12:03 Felt like the craziest thing.
15:12:05 Yeah.
15:12:06 Yeah.
15:12:06 Increation, camp.
15:12:08 Hmm.
15:12:09 That was…
15:12:08 Yeah, I was looking the other day at the video for, I think it was ben trill
15:12:14 Yeah.
15:12:14 Will you guys put up the orange tarp?
15:12:15 Yeah. Yeah.
15:12:18 Good night.
15:12:17 Yeah.
15:12:16 That's crazy, man. I remember when that first, when you first started teasing it on Instagram before dropping it on YouTube, I was dying. I was shitting myself. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen.
15:12:26 That's it.
15:12:27 Like Penn walking through the house outside and you're like, no.
15:12:30 Yeah. And I think we all found like that time was
15:12:34 highly…
15:12:35 impactful and just like
15:12:37 Yeah.
15:12:38 creating a momentum that's like, I still feel is like
15:12:43 Very present today.
15:12:45 Yeah.
15:12:44 For sure. Incubator is such a way to put it.
15:12:47 Yeah.
15:12:47 That shit was fucking…
15:12:50 Wait, sorry.
15:12:48 Damn. Okay, last two questions, last two questions.
15:12:52 Stick to Euro right now. What's one quality about yourself you hope you never lose?
15:12:57 That's for all of you. Start with Euro.
15:13:00 Probably…
15:13:01 Thank you.
15:13:02 Like dreams, like having dreams
15:13:07 Beautiful. Noah.
15:13:10 Yeah.
15:13:11 Yeah, the ability to continue moving and learning.
15:13:17 Wonderful, Penn.
15:13:19 All right.
15:13:18 Yeah. My playfulness.
15:13:22 and uh
15:13:24 definitely like
15:13:32 Yeah.
15:13:27 Yeah, mainly that. I feel like the playfulness is what allows everything else to like just be strong. Like every day is like.
15:13:34 You could do it and be here now. There's just like segment where it's like.
15:13:38 You could do it from a place of unk
15:13:40 Or you can do it from a…
15:13:42 You know, and I like that. I like that the seven A's, you know, just like that release. It's like an endless release
15:13:50 through the playfulness.
15:13:52 And life is just beautiful.
15:13:54 Man, you sing Ankh right now. I don't know what you mean by it, but for me, like I've been working on some coding assignments the past few days and the computer, I was training a model
15:14:03 And whenever it didn't know what word to spit out, it spit out unk, U-N-K.
15:14:08 Mm-hmm.
15:14:07 capital letters. And it's just like on my mind. I just see unk.
15:14:11 Yeah.
15:14:10 I don't know what it means yet, but I see Unk, baby.
15:14:13 Yeah, I feel like it's…
15:14:14 I think it means unknown, but…
15:14:16 Yeah. Jay Fags, bro.
15:14:18 Okay, last question, last question. We kind of covered it, but this is my final question. How do you know when something is finished?
15:14:27 You just do.
15:14:30 Because it's, I think.
15:14:31 Europe.
15:14:33 Yeah, I think it's, I mean, something I've found recently is that at a certain point I stop enjoying
15:14:42 Like, I guess…
15:14:44 like working on it and stuff and
15:14:47 Yeah.
15:14:46 Then I'm like, okay, maybe it's not for me now. Maybe it's now
15:14:50 It's ready for the next stage.
15:14:51 And that's just not that's going to enter a new phase of not being finished.
15:14:56 Mm-hmm.
15:14:56 Because then it's living in the world.
15:14:59 Mm-hmm.
15:14:59 Foquist?
15:15:01 Yeah, I would say the same as naming like uh
15:15:06 When it stops being fun, it stops feeling like play, then it's probably time to share that because
15:15:13 you don't want to ruin it for yourself.
15:15:15 being selfish
15:15:16 Mm-hmm.
15:15:18 It's always, dude, it's always feels like
15:15:22 After you do it.
15:15:25 It's done. After you have the first version.
15:15:28 Yeah.
15:15:30 Okay.
15:15:28 The first version and the second version aren't going to be the same thing.
15:15:31 So after the first version is done, best believe
15:15:33 by the time you close your computer and you say that that's the first version, that's done.
15:15:37 And then you doing anything else on top of it, like you're just getting to a second iteration of this
15:15:43 Good.
15:15:43 idea that you already had, you know? So it's hard to like capture the same spirit
15:15:49 It's so hard.
15:15:49 can't abuse the identifications.
15:15:50 Yeah, dude, like…
15:15:53 It's just crazy.
15:15:54 All right. Absolutely lovely.
15:15:58 Thank you so much for doing this. I want to leave you guys with a last little bit of semi-wisdom or something from one of my professors.
15:16:05 We were speaking about these models that we have for approximating, trying to model distributions of certain text.
15:16:13 Mm-hmm.
15:16:12 And she was saying something she repeated many times was every model is wrong.
15:16:17 But some are useful.
15:16:19 Hell yeah.
15:16:22 That's fire.
15:16:23 Appreciate the time, big boys.
15:16:23 That's 100% fact.
15:16:24 Every model is drawn.
15:16:25 Bye.
15:16:26 Yes. Yes.
15:16:28 It's like motherfuckers comparing like the Jordan like 14
15:16:34 to like the Jordan 6 or some shit where it's like, bro, like…
15:16:40 we wouldn't have the newest model if we didn't have any of these other models. But the point is to go past all models.
15:16:47 Good.
15:16:46 is to find the thing that allows you to keep going more than anything.
15:16:49 Bye.
15:16:49 No generalization is ever actually real.
15:16:53 Mm-hmm.
15:16:53 They can be like, oh, the average stone is this much, but you won't find…
15:16:58 That stone.
15:17:00 Yeah.
15:17:01 It's like 30% of rocks on the beach are flat that you pull up on the beach that's like, what the fuck, man? None of these rocks are flat, bro.
15:17:09 Who's writing these stats?
15:17:13 Let's fire.
15:17:13 All right, kiddos, I'll let you go. Thank you for the time. I'll keep you in touch with all of this and how it goes and what I write, etc.
15:17:20 Oh, yeah.
15:17:21 On the last bit is the photo shoot. If you guys are down for that.
15:17:25 Absolutely.
15:17:24 Let me know what you think in terms of timeline.
15:17:27 I don't want to take up a lot of your time, keep it simple, keep it easy.
15:17:30 Definitely, I'd say some kind of focus on
15:17:34 Looking absolutely dripped out as you always do?
15:17:37 Mm-hmm.
15:17:36 It doesn't have to be a fashion photo shoot, but I want to show that you guys are absolutely bloody with it.
15:17:42 And some amount of Vancouver as well.
15:17:45 Hell yeah.
15:17:49 Yeah.
15:17:45 But yeah, keep me up to date with that. It would be great to have it sometime before the end of the month, just like, you know, first week of December is fine as well.
15:17:52 Hell yeah. Yeah.
15:17:52 Probably do it this week.
15:17:55 Yeah.
15:17:54 Yeah, I think this week would be good.
15:17:57 Yeah.
15:17:56 So keep me up to date with that.
15:17:57 God bless.
15:17:59 Yeah.
15:17:59 Big kisses, big hugs.
15:18:01 I'll see you guys in January. I'll be back in Vancouver.
15:18:03 Booyah. Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
15:18:04 Yay! That was crazy.
15:18:06 party time.
15:18:07 Hey. You're the man, bro.
15:18:07 Stay safe till then. Kisses, big boys.
15:18:10 Good.
15:18:09 Thank you.
15:18:11 So.
15:18:11 I got to get back to fixing the reactor.
